This directory contains the PGXN Client builtin commands. If you want to
extend the client with your own command, please use the directory returned by
``pgxn help --libexec``. See the documentation for further information about
how to create new commands.

Note that setuptools doesn't do a perfect job and replaces the links with the
script content, dropping the executable flag. If you are packaging pgxnclient
for a distribution, you may use soft/hard links instead. The location of this
directory may also be changed if your distribution policies prefer a better
location (e.g.  ``/usr/lib/pgxnclient/libexec``...): in this case change the
`LIBEXECDIR` constant in ``pgxnclient/__init__.py`` with the absolute path of
the scripts directory.
